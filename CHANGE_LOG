v2.8.0

This release makes Docker configuration the default.

It is no longer necessary for non-developers to clone this repository,
and instead users should be using the Docker image available on Docker hub from 
https://hub.docker.com/r/aquariumbio/aquarium:
- For production deployment, see the deployment instructions at aquarium.bio.
- For a local deployment, clone https://github.com/klavinslab/aquarium-local.

Changes:
- Rewrite entrypoint script so that provides more capabilities for configuring
  Aquarium.
- Change creation interface for users and groups to make it easier to script
  adding users.
- Parameterize database and application configuration with environment variables.
- Change puma configuration so that database.yml can contain ERB.
- Flip docker-compose files so that development mode is the default.
- Change Dockerfile to use a multi-stage build with a development stage,
  a production-build stage, and the stage for the production image.
- Make changes so that asset precompilation can occur in Docker production-build.
  Includes removing unnecessary monkey patches, and parameterizing database.yml
  file.
- Consolidated deployment configuration with previous docker configuration, and
  parameterized configuration using environment variables and a YAML file for 
  instance details. Change S3 configuration to use either S3 or minio based on
  environment variables.

- Refactor models to use predicates instead of chained checks of attributes.
