# Aquarium Development Guide

These guidelines are intended for those working directly on Aquarium.

---

## Getting Started

Follow the Aquarium installation instructions at
<a href="aquarium.bio">aquarium.bio</a>
to get a local copy of the Aquarium git repository.

## Running Aquarium

To run Aquarium in development mode using the Docker configuration in a Unix&trade;-like environment, do the following.

### Initial steps

Make the `develop-compose.sh` script executable

```bash
chmod u+x develop-compose.sh
```

### Commands

1. Build the docker images with

   ```bash
   ./develop-compose.sh build
   ```

   This should only be necessary the first time you run Aquarium in development mode.
   However, it may be needed any time you change the Aquarium configuration.
   In situations where dependencies change, you will also want to run `build` with the `--no-cache` option.

2. Start Aquarium with

   ```bash
   ./develop-compose.sh up
   ```

   This command starts services for Aquarium, Krill, MySQL, minio and nginx, which are needed to run Aquarium.
   In development mode, Aquarium is available at `localhost:3000` instead of `localhost`.

   To stop the services, type `ctrl-c` followed by

   ```bash
   ./develop-compose down -v
   ```

3. To run commands inside the Aquarium Ruby environment, precede each with

   ```bash
   ./develop-compose.sh run --rm app
   ```

   Specifically, you can run a shell within the Aquarium container with the command

   ```bash
   ./develop-compose.sh run --rm app /bin/sh
   ```

   where you can run `rake` or even the Rails console.

Note: The `develop-compose.sh` script helps shorten each command.
Without the script, each command would start with

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml
```

instead of the script name.

## Switching databases

The configuration for Docker uses the MySQL Docker image, which is capable of automatically importing a database dump the first time it is started.
This is convenient for standard usage, but it makes it harder to switch to another database.

Switching databases will destroy any changes you have made to the current database.
If you want to save these, you will have to create a database dump.

To make database dump, using the values of `MYSQL_USER` and `MYSQL_PASSWORD` from `docker-compose.yml` run the following

```bash
MYSQL_USER=<username>
MYSQL_PASSWORD=<password>
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec db mysqldump -u $MYSQL_USER -p$MYSQL_PASSWORD production > production_dump.sql
docker-compose down -v
```

You can then safely remove the MySQL files to allow the switch by running

```bash
rm -rf docker/db/*
```

Then copy the dump of the database that you want to use to the default location:

```bash
cp desired_dump.sql docker/mysql_init/dump.sql
```

It may be necessary to run migrations on database dump from a prior version of Aquarium.
See the Docker installation instructions at <a href="aquarium.bio">aquarium.bio</a> for details.

## Restoring the default database dump

If you want to restart from an empty database, you can run

```bash
cp docker/mysql_init/default.sql docker/mysql_init/dump.sql
```

Before restarting Aquarium, remove the MySQL files with

```bash
rm -rf docker/db/*
```

## Testing Aquarium

```bash
./develop-compose.sh up -d
./develop-compose.sh exec app rspec
./develop-compose.sh down -v
```

## Editing Aquarium

### Documenting changes

### Formatting Aquarium code

The Aquarium repository is setup to use [RuboCop](https://rubocop.readthedocs.io).
Settings are in the `.rubocop.yml` file in the repository directory.
When the Rails or Ruby versions are changed the target versions in this file should also be changed.
Otherwise, you probably wont need to change this file.

When you make changes to Aquarium code, run the `rubocop` command to see if you have introduced any issues.
This will check for several potential issues that occur in Rails apps.
Note that it will always complain about the `JOB::NOT_STARTED` and `JOB::COMPLETED`, but, because of the `.rubocop_todo.yml` file, any other issues that are found should be things that you have introduced.
You should fix them.
If you only have `Layout` issues, use `rubocop -x` to do it automatically.
RuboCop can do other auto-corrections, but don't use that feature unless your tests ensure that the behavior is not changed.

### Documenting Aquarium Ruby Code

Aquarium Ruby methods and classes should be documented with [Yardoc](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/yard/file/docs/GettingStarted.md) regardless of whether they are public.

For instance, a function would be documented as

```ruby
# Display the instructions for centerfuging the given tubes.
#
# @param tubes [Array] the array of items representing tubes
def centerfuge_instructions(tubes)
  ...
end
```

unless a hash argument is used, in which case the comment would look like

```ruby
# Copy the data associations from the source item to the target item.
#
# @param args [Hash] the arguments indicating source and target items
# @option args [String] :source  the source item
# @option args [String] :target  the target item
def copy_associations(args)
  ...
end
```

Note that an argument with a default value is _not_ an option, and should just be listed using the `@param` tag.

Here are some ([borrowed](http://blog.joda.org/2012/11/javadoc-coding-standards.html)) style guidelines for documentation:

- Write your comments to be read from the source file.
  So, add formatting that is helpful to the programmer reading your code.
- The first sentence of the should be short, clear and to the point.
  Use the third person, e.g., "Returns the item ID for..."
- If documenting a class, use "this" to refer to an instance of the class.
- Aim for one (short) sentence per line.
  Each should end with a period.
- Use `@param` for all parameters, `@return` for return values, and `@raise` for exceptions raised.
  List these in that order.
- Put a single blank line after the first sentence, and then one after each paragraph.
  (If this doesn't give you a line before the first `@param` add one.)
- Write `@param` and `@raise` as a phrase starting with a lowercase letter and almost always the word "the", but with no period.
- Write `@raise` as a conditional phrase beginning with "if".
  Again, don't end the phrase with a period.

See also these yard [examples](https://gist.github.com/chetan/1827484)

The return value of a function should be documented using the `@return` tag, and any exception raised by a function should be documented with the `@raise` tag.
But, there are many more [tags](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/yard/file/docs/Tags.md#Tag_List) available, and you should feel free to use them.

Running the command

```bash
yardoc
```

will generate the documentation and write it to the directory `docs/api`.
This location is determined by the file `.yardopts` in the project repository.
This file also limits the API to code used in Krill the protocol development language.

## Making an Aquarium Release

1.  make sure Rails tests pass

    ```bash
    ./develop-compose.sh exec app rspec
    ```

2.  Run `rubocop`, fix anything broken. Once done run `rubocop --auto-gen-config`.
3.  (make sure JS tests pass)
4.  Make sure JS linting passes
5.  Update the version number in `package.json` and `config/initializers/version.rb` to the new version number.
6.  Update API documentation by running 

    ```bash
    ./develop-compose.sh exec app yard
    ```

7.  (Update change log)
8.  Commit and push changes.
9.  Create a tag for the new version:

    ```bash
    git tag -a v$NEWVERSION -m "Aquarium version $NEWVERSION"
    git push --tags
    ```

10. [Create a release on github](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/).
    Visit the [Aquarium releases page](https://github.com/klavinslab/aquarium/releases).
    Click "Tags".
    Click "add release notes" for the new tag, use the change log as the release notes.
    Click "publish release".
11. (Update zenodo entry)

## Docker configuration

The Aquarium Docker configuration is determined by these files:

```bash
aquarium
|-- Dockerfile                  # defines the image for Aquarium
|-- docker
|   |-- aquarium                # Aquarium configuration files
|   |-- aquarium-entrypoint.sh  # entrypoint for running Aquarium
|   |-- db                      # directory to store database files
|   |-- krill-entrypoint.sh     # entrypoint for running Krill
|   |-- mysql_init              # database dump to initialize database
|   |-- nginx.development.conf  # nginx configuration for development server
|   |-- nginx.production.conf   # nginx configuration for production server
|   `-- s3                      # directory for minio files
|-- docker-compose.dev.yml      # development compose file
|-- docker-compose.override.yml # production compose file
|-- docker-compose.windows.yml  # windows compose file
`-- docker-compose.yml          # base compose file
```

### Images

The `Dockerfile` configures the `basebuilder` Aquarium image that contains the configuration needed by development or production environments.

The `basebuilder` image is based on the Ruby Alpine linux Docker image that includes Rails.
In addition the image includes:

1. Development tools needed to configure and run Aquarium.
2. Javascript components used by Aquarium webpages.
3. Gems used by Aquarium.
4. The `aquarium` application (minus the files in `.dockerignore`).
5. The entrypoint scripts for running Aquarium and Krill from Docker.

Note that this base configuration includes the configuration files in `config`, though the docker-compose configurations override these.

copies rails configuration files from the `docker/aquarium` directory into the correct place in the image; and adds the `docker/aquarium-entrypoint.sh` and `docker/krill-entrypoint.sh` scripts for starting the Aquarium services.
The configuration also ensures that the `docker/db` and `docker/s3` directories needed for the database and [minio](https://minio.io) S3 server are created on the host as required by the compose files.
The `devbuilder` and `prodbuilder` configurations build an image with environment specific files.

### Compose files

The docker-compose files are defined to allow Aquarium to be run locally in production or development modes and on Windows.

Specifically, the files are meant to be combined as follows:

- `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.override.yml` runs production,
- `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.dev.yml` runs development, and
- adding `docker-compose.windows.yml` allows MySQL to run on Windows.

The order of the files is significant since the later files add or replace definitions from the base file.

Note that the command for the first combination

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml up
```

is equivalent to the simpler command

```bash
docker-compose up
```

The compose files are designed so that running in production is the default configuration to support users who are doing protocol development on a local instance.
To support this, the `docker-compose.yml` file contains the common configuration for both environments, including identifying the entrypoints for Aquarium and Krill, mounting host directories used by Aquarium, MySQL and minio for persistent storage.
The file `docker-compose.override.yml` is run by default and adds production environment files to the base configuration, while `docker-compose.dev.yml` adds the configurations for the development environment.

Much of the key differences between environments are handled by mounting different files with the different configurations.
For instance, the Rails configuration files are replaced by files from `docker/aquarium` that are mounted over the counterparts in `config`.
In the case of configuring MySQL and nginx, the mount points for the configuration files are particular to the image used for these services, some of which are not terribly well documented.
Using volumes in this way is convenient, but can also be the source of great mystery when a mounted volume overrides the files in the image.
Tweak the volumes with care.

### Database

The `docker/mysql_init` directory contains the database dump that is used to initialize the database when it is run the first time.
The MySQL service is configured to use the `docker/db` directory to store its files, and removing the contents of this directory (`rm -rf docker/db/*`) will cause the database to initialize the next time the service is started.

### Local S3 server

A [minio](minio.io) service `s3` is used to manage files uploaded to Aquarium in the local configuration.
The `s3` service is configured so that these files are stored in `docker/s3`.
The current configuration does not allow the pre-signed URLs returned by Aquarium to be used because the host is configured to be the hostname of the service, which is only accessible from within Docker.
However, the files are also be accessible through the minio webclient at `localhost:9000`.

### Local web server

Access to Aquarium and the S3 webclient is handled by nginx.
For development, all requests to port 3000 are forwarded to Aquarium, while for production, static files are served by nginx and other requests are handled by puma via a socket.
See the nginx configuration files in the `docker` directory.
