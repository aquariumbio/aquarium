Data Associations
===

`Item`, `Operation` and `Plan` objects may have data associated with them using the `DataAssociation` model. 
Suppose that `p` is an object (such as an Aquarium `Item`). 
Then the follow methods are available.

Setting data
---

* `p.associate(key, value, upload=nil)`: 
Associate value with key. 
The parameter upload must either not be present, or should refer to a valid, saved `Upload` object.

* `p.notes= text`: Associate the text field `"text"` with  `p`.

* `p.append_notes text`: Append the notes in `"text"` to the already existing notes (if any).

Getting data
---

* `p.associations`: 
Returns `HashWithIndifferentAccess` `h` where `h[key]` is the value of the datum for the key. 
The value can be any legal combination of hashes, arrays, strings, or numbers. The key may be a symbol or a string. May be chained.

* `p.get key`: Returns the value of the data assocated with given key. May be chained.

* `upload key`: Returns the uploaded data, if any, associated with the given key. May be chained.

* `p.notes`: The key `"notes"` (or `:notes`) is reserved for a text valued datum holding a user's textual notes on the parent object `p`. For example, in the sample browser UI, the user may add notes by finding the item and clicking on the notes icon.

Example
---

As an example, suppose `i` is an `Item` and `u` is an `Upload`. Then one might do

```ruby
i.associate(:row, 12).associate(:col, 14).associate(:image,{},u)
i.notes = "Hello"
i.append_notes " World"
i.associations # => [ row: 12, col: 14, image: {}, notes: "Hello World"]
i.get(:row) # => 12
i.upload(:image) # => <An Aquarium Upload ActiveRecord>
```
